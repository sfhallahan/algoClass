/*
Algorithm Complexity:  You need to know basic Big-O and be able to analyze common algorithms.

Sorting:  You should know the details of at least one n*log(n) sorting algorithm.

Graphs:  There are 3 basic ways to represent a graph in memory (objects and pointers, matrix, and adjacency list); 
familiarize yourself with each representation and its pros & cons. You should know the basic graph traversal algorithms: 
breadth-first search and depth-first search. Know their computational complexity, their tradeoffs, and how to implement 
them in real code.

Trees:  Know about trees; basic tree construction, traversal and manipulation algorithms. Familiarize yourself with binary trees, 
n-ary trees, and trie-trees. Be familiar with at least one type of balanced binary tree. Understand tree traversal algorithms: 
BFS and DFS, and know the difference between inorder, postorder and preorder.

Other Data Structures and Algorithms:  Know how to write a hash table. Know basic sampling techniques, 
binary search and other CS 101 algorithms. Be prepared to discuss different ways to optimize your code.

Mathematics:  Basic knowledge of counting problems, probability problems, and other Discrete Math 101 situations. 
Spend some time before the interview refreshing your memory on (or teaching yourself) the essentials of combinatorics 
and probability. You should be familiar with n-choose-k problems and their ilk.
